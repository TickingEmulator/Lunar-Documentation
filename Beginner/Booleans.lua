local Are_You_Hungry = false

--[[ You may have seen booleans on fundamentals and variables page today we're going to explain what they do.
     Booleans can be used on different types of instructions, whether it being telling the program something is false or something is true.
     An example of this is whether you are hungry. If you are not hungry than you'd probably be set to false for being hungry...Otherwise true.
     Booleans are important in programming and can help your program make descions. More about booleans later on till than!
